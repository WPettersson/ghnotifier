This is a fork from https://github.com/kunicmarko20/ghnotifier

This Python app will show you number of notifications in your status bar and
send you github notifications to your Linux notifications.

# Token generation

You need to [create a GitHub Personal Access
Token](https://github.com/settings/apps) to use this program. In particular,
you need a "classic" token and need to enable the "notifications" scope.

# Dependencies:

If you are having trouble with dependencies, try following this
[guide](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html).

You may need to install a libayatana-appindicator3 package as well - the
installation of this package is distribution-specific.
